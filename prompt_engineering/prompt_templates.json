Contextual information (e.g., mentions of symptoms related to kidney issues)\nd.Semantic relations (e.g., treatments commonly associated with kidney conditions).\ne.Semantic meaning (e.g., implications that indicate a focus on kidney health).\nf.References to related research or conditions (e.g., studies on dialysis).\n\n2. Based on the extracted CLUES and the context provided in the title and abstract, deduce a diagnostic REASONING process. Explain how the CLUES support your classification decision. Consider the following in your REASONING:\na. How the CLUES indicate the presence or absence of kidney-related topics.\nb. The relevance and strength of each CLUE in supporting your decision.\nc. The overall context and how it ties the CLUES together.\n\n3. Determine the CLASS based on the CLUES, your REASONING process, and the given title and abstract.\n\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format: {\"clues\": [<CLUE_1>, <CLUE_2>, ...], \"reasoning\": <INSERT REASONING>, \"class\": <INSERT CLASS>}. DO NOT include any other text in your response."
